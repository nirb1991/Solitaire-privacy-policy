      <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the <strong>Solitaire</strong> mobile application (the “App”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) handles information when you use the App. We designed the App to be privacy‑friendly and to work with minimal (or no) data collection. If you disagree with any part of this policy, please do not use the App.</p>

      <h2>1. Data we collect</h2>
      <p>We strive to collect as little information as possible. Depending on how the App is configured, the following apply:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No personal data by default.</strong> The App does not collect your name, email, phone number, or other personally identifiable information.</li>
        <li><strong>Local game data.</strong> Game settings and progress (for example: current score, completed levels, user preferences) are stored locally on your device so you can continue where you left off.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional diagnostic data.</strong> If you opt into crash reporting or we include a crash‑reporting tool, limited diagnostic information may be collected to help fix crashes. These logs generally contain device type, OS version, and technical details about the crash and do not include your personal content.</li>
        <li><strong>No ad identifiers unless you add ads.</strong> The App does not access advertising identifiers or track users for advertising unless you (the developer) integrate and enable an ad SDK. If you enable ads, you must update this policy to reflect which ad networks are used and what data they collect.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. How we use data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>To provide and maintain the App.</strong> Local data is used to restore game state and remember preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>To improve the App.</strong> If diagnostic or anonymous usage metrics are collected, we use them to identify bugs, improve performance, and optimize gameplay.</li>
        <li><strong>To comply with law.</strong> We may disclose data if required by law or to protect legal rights.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Data sharing and third parties</h2>
      <p>We do not sell your personal data. We do not share personal information with third parties for their own uses, except in the narrow circumstances described below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Crash reporting / analytics services:</strong> If integrated, third‑party SDKs may receive anonymous or aggregated diagnostic data. You are responsible for selecting and configuring any third‑party services and for keeping this policy updated to describe their practices.</li>
        <li><strong>Apple and platform providers:</strong> The App may use platform services (for example, Apple Game Center) — these services are governed by the provider’s privacy policies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Data retention</h2>
      <p>Local data (game progress and settings) remains on your device for as long as the App is installed. If the App uses analytics or crash logs, those are retained only as long as needed to diagnose and resolve issues.</p>

      <h2>5. Children</h2>
      <p>The App is intended for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or the minimum age applicable in your jurisdiction). If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us and we will take steps to remove that information.</p>

      <h2>6. Security</h2>
      <p>We follow standard security practices to protect data stored locally on a device. Because the App does not transmit personal data to remote servers by default, the risk of remote data breach is limited. However, no app can guarantee absolute security.</p>

      <h2>7. Your rights and choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Access / Correction / Deletion:</strong> Because the App stores data locally, you can delete the App to remove locally stored game data. If you need assistance deleting local data or if you believe we have any personal data about you, contact us at the email below.</li>
        <li><strong>Opt‑out:</strong> If optional analytics or crash reporting is enabled, you may be able to opt out through the App settings or your device settings (depending on implementation).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy when the App changes (for example, if we add online features, ads, or analytics). The "Last updated" date at the top will reflect the effective date. If we make significant changes, we will aim to notify users via the App or the App Store listing.</p>

      <h2>9. Contact</h2>
      <p>If you have questions, requests, or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact:</p>
      <address>
        <strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:nir.b91@gmail.com">nir.b91@gmail.com</a><br />

      <h3>Notes for App Store listing</h3>
      <p>When submitting to the Apple App Store, you may use this summary for the App Store privacy details (e.g., "No data collected" or "Data linked to you: None"). If you enable any analytics/ads or integrate Game Center, update the App Store privacy fields accordingly.</p>
